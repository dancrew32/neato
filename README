Neato is a simple php framework that helps spin up sites with controllers and views. It has lessphp integrated and can minify in production mode. 

(Still a work in progress)

index.php - main site configuration file

/core
	db.php - db connection library
	app.php - app functionality (routing, template parser, less compiler, caching, ajax detection, etc...)
	helpers.php - simple function shortcuts

/lib
	write your classes here and they get automatically included (just setup your routes)
	access methods with GET($params) or POST($params)

/view
	view templates that you may associate with your controllers

/db
	database dump storage

/scripts
	useful scripts (e.g. db dump/restore

/css
	base.css (main output file) and base.less file storage. @import files in base.less and they're automatically compiled and output in base.css. if mode is production, base.css is minified

/js
	simple javascript library and plugins
